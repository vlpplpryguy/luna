My Personal Robot

This Repo contains the modules I use to develope my personal robot Luna.

Most code is adapted mobile apps strapped to useful api's that give luna versatile functionality. Leveraging existing code to perform task is far better than the traditional "build it from scratch" or "deep-learning algorithms."

Other code may be for stabilization software/drivers for the hardware side of this project (BBB/arduino).
