# luna

This Repo contains the modules I use to develop my personal robot Luna.

Most files are adapted mobile apps strapped to useful api's that give Luna versatile functionality. Leveraging existing code to perform tasks is far better than the traditional "build it from scratch" or "deep-learning algorithms."

Other code may be for stabilization software/drivers for the hardware side of this project (BBB/arduino).
